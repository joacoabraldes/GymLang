# GymLang

GymLang is a domain-specific language to describe gym training routines and their schedule, and
compile them into an interactive HTML page. The compiler is written in C with Flex (lexer) and
Bison (parser), and implements the three phases: lexical/syntactic analysis (frontend), semantic
analysis and code generation (backend).

The full specification and design notes are available under [doc/](doc/).

## Requirements

* [Docker v28.3.2](https://www.docker.com/)

## Configuration

Set the following environment variables to control and configure the behaviour of the application:

| Name                  | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| :-------------------- | :-----: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ENVIRONMENT`         | `Local` | The active environment name. The available environments are: `Local`, `Development` and `Production`.                                                                 |
| `LOG_IGNORED_LEXEMES` | `true`  | When `true`, logs all of the ignored lexemes found with Flex at `DEBUGGING` level. To remove those logs from the console output set it to `false`.                    |
| `LOGGING_LEVEL`       | `ALL`   | The minimum level to log in the console output. From lower to higher, the available levels are: `ALL`, `DEBUGGING`, `INFORMATION`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` and `CRITICAL`. |

_Docker Compose_ can read the variables from an `.env` file too (see `compose.yaml` file).

## Commands

### Start

Rises an ephemeral container, ready to start development:

```bash
docker compose run --rm compiler
```

### Build

Builds or rebuilds the entire compiler:

```bash
src/main/bash/build.sh
```

### Run

Compiles a program:

```bash
src/main/bash/run.sh <program>
```

where `<program>` is the path to the file that represents its entry-point.

### Test

Executes every available unit-test under `src/test/c` folder:

```bash
src/main/bash/test.sh
```

## Output

When a program is accepted, the compiler writes a self-contained `output.html` file in the current
directory. Open it in any browser (no server required) to see every workout rendered by blocks, a
set-by-set breakdown, the session summary (volume, total sets and estimated time) and a simulated
clock with an adjustable speed multiplier that walks through the schedule.

### Stop

Logout, destroy the ephemeral containers and shutdowns the cluster:

```bash
exit
docker compose down
```

### Docker

| Command                                 | Description                                             |
| :-------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `docker builder prune --all`            | Removes all builds and complete build cache.            |
| `docker compose --progress=plain build` | Forces a build or rebuild of the images in the cluster. |
| `docker image prune`                    | Removes all of the dangling images from Docker.         |
| `docker network prune`                  | Removes unused networks from Docker.                    |
| `docker volume prune`                   | Removes unused volumes from Docker.                     |

## CI/CD

To trigger an automatic integration on every push or PR (_Pull Request_), you must activate _GitHub Actions_ in the _Settings_ tab. Use the following configuration:

| Key                                                        | Value                                               |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `Actions permissions`                                      | `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`          |
| `Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests` | `false`                                             |
| `Artifact and log retention`                               | `30 days`                                           |
| `Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators`   | `Require approval for all outside collaborators`    |
| `Workflow permissions`                                     | `Read repository contents and packages permissions` |
